Hadoop is reiliable, distributed and scalable platform for storing and analyzing big data.
It runs well on cheap commodity hardware, competitors require expensive hardware.
Hadoop is designed to detect and handle failures at the application layer, making cheap hardware a viable option.
Named after the creator's son's toy elephant, 'Hadoop'.
This project was gifted to the Apache Foundation and sparked other projects

Data comes in 3 types:
1) Structured: has some pre-defined organizational property making it easily searchable and analyzable.  Data is backed by a model that dictates the size of each field.  SQL is commonly used since schema is defined
2) Unstructured:  Characterized by a lack of organization and data model that describes the structure of a single record or attribtues of any individual fields within the record.  Videos, audio, blogs, log files.
3) Semi-structured:  No explicit data model or structure definition.  Contains semi-semantic tags but does not conform to the structure associated with structured data.  JSON and XML are examples.

Database Management System(DBMS)
A DBMS is a software that allows the user to create, maintain and delete multiple individual databases.  It provides peripheral services and interfaces for the end-user to interact with the databases

Database: An organized and structured collection of data, usually stored and retrieved electronically.  A database usually lives in a database management system.  The structure and organization helps achieve efficient data retrieval.  2 broad kinds, Relational/Non-Relational

Relational/SQL databases:  Consist of data stored as rows in tables.  The columns of a table follow a defined schema that describes the type and size of the data that a table column can hold.  Think of a schema as a blueprint of each record or row in the table.
Non-Relational/NoSQL databases: As data handled by internet companies grew, a new approach to designing databases came to be.  The strict schema of relational databases was impractical.  NoSQL databases come in different forms and address different use cases
    - Key-value stores: Redis, DynamoDB
    - Column stores: HBase, Cassandra
    - Document stores: MongoDB, Couchbase
    - Graph databases: Neo4
    - Search engines: Solr, Elasticsearch, Splunk

The primary difference between NoSQL and SQL databases is the absense of a rigid schema in the former.

Big Data Defined:  Data with greater variety arriving in increasing volumes and with even higher velocity that requires a scalable architecture for efficient storage, manipulation and analysis.  Properties are often referred to as the 3 V's:
- Volume: Sheer amount of data
- Velocity: Rate at which data is received and acted on.  Higher velocity data streams directly into memory, instead of being written to disk.
- Variety: Variety refers to the many types of available data.  Structured data can be organized neatly within the columns of a database.

In recent times, a few more V's have been added to the characteristics of Big Data:
- Veracity: Refers to the quality of the collected data
- Value: Tangible benefits that an organization can derive from data
- Visualization: The creation of complex graphs that tell the datas story
- Variability: The meaning and context can change.  Variability can be used to discover meaning


Big Data vs Data Warehouse: Data warehouse is a system that pulls data from many different sources to an organization, transforms and stores it for reporting and analysis purposes.  A data warehouse stores large quantities of historical data and enables fast, complex queries across all data.
OLAP - Online Analytical Processing is used in the context of data warehousing.  OLAP enables the data to be optimized to handle low number of complex queries on aggregated large historical data sets

Databases are more commonly used for OLTP: Online Transaction Processing(OLTP).  Databases use OLTP to delete, insert, replace and update large numbers of short, online transactions.  These databases are not optimized for complex analytical queries because of the number of table joins required.  This is where data warehouses start to shine.  They formate and potentially even combine with other data sources allowing for faster processing of complex queries.

Data Lake: A big data concepts that refers to the storage of raw, unstructured and structured data from multiple sources, when the data's use has not yet been determined.  It hosts data of all types sizes and formats.  A data warehouse, by contrast, will carry processed data actively used for analysis.  Data Mart is another term: a subject-oriented subset of the data warehouse.
